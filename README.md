# Lumiclone

This is a clone of [Lumines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/851670/LUMINES_REMASTERED/) built entirely in React.

## Motivations
I played a lot of Lumines on my cellphone back in 2008 before my phone eventually broke. As the years gone past, there always was the itch to play, but I was too cheap to shell out $8.50 to buy the actual game. 10 years later, having just learnt some React, I thought: "Hey Lumines like Tetris right? Should be a light exercise to bang out a workable version."

Fast forward 11 months (with about 7 months of hiatus), this POC is finally ready. Turns out the light exercise was more of a marathon ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Was 4 months of development worth $8.50? Probaby not.
Does the current version run like a bitcoin miner is embedded? Yes.
Would I do it again if given the chance? Definitely.
Hotel? Trivago.
